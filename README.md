# Introduction

The Image-Renaming-App is a specialized software solution designed to address the intricate challenges of organizing and managing annotated imaging data within the biological research domain. By leveraging case viewer annotations, this tool introduces a systematic approach to renaming and consolidating annotated image files, thereby enhancing the efficiency of data retrieval and analysis workflows.

# Key Features

* Annotation-Based Renaming: The application integrates a robust renaming mechanism that utilizes the metadata from case viewer annotations. This ensures that each image file is renamed in a manner that reflects its specific annotated content, facilitating easier identification and categorization of data.

* Centralized Data Repository: In addition to renaming, the tool compiles all annotated images into a unified directory named "pooled images." This centralized repository enables researchers to access their entire annotated dataset conveniently, streamlining the data analysis process.

* Preservation of Original Data: Recognizing the paramount importance of data integrity in scientific research, the Image-Renaming-App is designed to keep the original images with their annotations intact in their original locations, ensuring the preservation of the initial dataset for verification and reproducibility.

# Deployment and Usage

**Installation**

The Image-Renaming-App is provided as a self-contained executable file [Image-Renaming-App.exe](https://github.com/Anas-Odeh/Image-Renaming-App/releases/tag/Image-Renaming-App), facilitating straightforward deployment without the need for complex setup procedures.

**Execution**

To initiate the app, simply execute the Image-Renaming-App.exe. The software automatically scans for image files with case viewer annotations within the specified directory, applies the annotation-based renaming protocol, and aggregates the renamed images into the "pooled images" folder.

**Application Scenarios**

This tool is particularly valuable in fields such as histology, pathology, and environmental biology, where annotated images play a critical role in research documentation and analysis. It offers a streamlined solution for managing large volumes of annotated imaging data, ensuring that researchers can focus on their scientific inquiries with enhanced data organization support.
